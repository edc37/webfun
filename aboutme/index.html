    <p>Hi, I'm Emily! This is my first programming course ever! I am also learning python in a different class, so I'm just jumping head first into programming.</p>
    <p>I have been married for 5 years and we have two kids. I was able to graduate with my Associates degree, but missed learning and using the critical thinking 
        part of my brain, so I'm continuing my education with Pathways. I've taken a computer hardware class, as well as a couple networking classes. While the hardware class 
        was very cool, I didn't see myself working on computers; the networking classes were interesting and gave me an appreciation and understanding of how computer communicate, 
        but I wasn't a fan of the class format. I had also taken a class on Microsoft Excel and really enjoyed that one, so after lots of encouragement from my husband, I am now taking
        some programming classes! It's still only the first week, but so far I'm enjoying everything and excited to learn more. We'll see if I can keep up that attitude as the 
        semester continues.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies include baking/cooking, playing video games (currently replaying Hollow Knight, but dreaming about Animal Crossing...ALSo BOTW2!), watching my husband
        play his games (he's finally set down Elden Ring and is now playing Death's Door), going on walks with my family, and working out...sometimes. This makes me sound much more
        interesting than I actually am. For some reason, when I became a mom, I lost a lot of my personality and interests, so really I'm figuring out who I am again. I'm creating
        new and better habbits and learning how to kick some less productive ones. </p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church my whole life, and as I've grown up and moved around, I have learned so much more and strengthened my testimony. I love this gospel and am 
        so grateful to have it as part of my life. My son is three but already says prayers, and there is nothing sweeter than watching him grow and develop a testimony, however 
        small it may be right now.
    </p>
