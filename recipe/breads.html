            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk dry ingredients together, then add water. Mix until shaggy, but all flour is hydrated.</li>
                <li>Cover bowl with plastic wrap and allwo to rise at room temp over night (I make the dough right before bed).</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>1 Day Later...</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 with dutch oven inside.</li>
                <li>Dump dough onto a floured surface (I like to do it on parchment paper, makes the transferring easier), and shape into a circle/oval.</li>
                <li>Remove dutch oven from preheated ove and transfer dough into dutch oven, putting the lid back on.</li>
                <li>Bake with lid for 30 minutes, then without lid for 15 more (total of 45 minutes).</li>
                <li>Allow to cool (or don't, can't resist hot, freshly baked bread), slice, and enjoy!</li>

                <li>3 cups Warm Water (90-100 degrees)</li>

            <h4>Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine water, yeast, and 1/2 tsp sugar in small bowl. Set aside and allow to bloom, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>In a stand mixer with dough hook (or large bowl), combine 3 1/2 cups flour, salt, 2 Tbs sugar, butter, and water mixture, and allow to mix. </li>
                <li>Add a cup of flour at a time, allowing to fully incorporate, until the dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
                <li>Knead for 5 - 8 minutes. Dough should be tacky but not necessarily sticky.</li>
                <li>Transfer dough to a lightly oiled/sprayed bowl. Cover and allow to rise for 30-45 minutes.</li>
                <li>When finished rising, give your dough a nice punch to get rid of all that air.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into 6 - 8 pieces (depending on how big you want your bowls & how many you want)</li>
                <li>Take a dough piece, flatten it a little with your finger tips, then fold the corners into the middle. Keep doing that until your piece is now kind of ball-shaped.</li>
                <li>Hold your hand over the dough ball to form a sort of cage, trapping the dough between your hand and the counter. Then swirl the dough around until it forms a nicer looking ball.</li>
                <li>Repeat with remaining dough lumps, placing the balls onto a parchment lined baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Make a nice little 'x' on the tops of the dough balls with a serrated knife, for the aesthetic.</li>
                <li>Beat egg white with milk and lightly brush tops of dough balls. Lightly cover with plastic wrap and allow to rise for 30-45 minutes.</li>
                <li>Bake at 400 degrees for 25-30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Allow to cool before cutting. Enjoy with your favorite soup!</li>
