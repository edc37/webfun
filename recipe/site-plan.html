        Introduction
      </h4>
      <p>
        Hi, there! I'm Emily and I don't know how to not be awkward when introducing myself, so I'm not going to try to stop it.
        I love food. I enjoy cooking, baking, eating, and sharing. Food is my love language. I know I'm not alone when I say that food is the way to my heart.
        My husband and friends bribe me with food. My kids even bribe my with food. It's just so good. I great up a picky eater, which doesn't technically
        give me credibility, but I like to pretend it does. Growing up, though, food was a big part of my life and my family. My parents are both great cooks,
        and we had people over all the time for dinner. I definitely learned to love sharing meals through that. I've also been watching cooking videos for ages, far
        before I learned how to do anything in the kitchen.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not learn how to cook until I left for college. I remember calling my mom and asking her how to cook a chicken breast in the oven.
        And you know what she told me? She told me to just look up a recipe and use the temp and time from that. I was so confused and nervous. Now I use recipes
        more as guidelines. Some of the recipes you find here I follow exactly, others I tweak just a little, and still others I change based on what I feel like doing.
        Baking is a little more finicky, depending on what you're making, but with cooking you can really experiment with flavors and techniques. I hope
        this website can introduce you to some new dishes and help you love cooking like I do. Or more, that's defnitely possible. I hope you can gain some confidence
        in the kitchen. I am by no means an expert; just an average lady that likes to eat food, but I'm happy to share what I know with those looking to learn.

      <h3>Breads</h3>
      <p>
        I love bread. Ya know in Spiderman: Homecoming when he's got Donald Glover webbed to a car and is "interrogating him" and they're comparing sandwich shops,
        and Spiderman says some place has too much bread? And Donald Glover says, "I like bread."? Yeah, that's me. That's my motto. I like bread. I am 
        by no means perfect at it, and have much to learn still, but I think too many people are afraid of bread. Sure, it takes some practice, but it's bread.
        It's worth it. And definitely not as scary as you think.

      </ul>
      <h3>Desserts</h3>
      <p>
        Do I even need to say anything? It's desserts. It's cookies and pies and...idk, stuff made of mostly sugar. Probably mostly cookies. My husband and I 
        have little to no self restraint when it comes to sweets (and really food in general), so I try not to make desserts too often. But we have people
        over all the time and I totally use that as an excuse to make desserts. So bake at your own risk I guess.

        Since this is a recipe website, pages 2 and 3 will have the same layout, but with different pictures and recipes.
